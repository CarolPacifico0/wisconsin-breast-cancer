  Wisconsin Breast Cancer Classification

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)** dataset to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on various cell nucleus features.

# Dataset Overview

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Instances**: 569 patients
- **Features**: 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of breast mass FNA (fine needle aspirate)
- **Target**: Diagnosis (0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant)

 Exploratory Data Analysis

Class Distribution
![Class Distribution](Images/class_distribution.png)

The dataset is imbalanced, with a majority of benign samples.

 Model Building
 Algorithm: Logistic Regression  
We split the dataset into training and test sets (80/20 split), scaled the features, and applied logistic regression to predict tumor classification.

Evaluation Metrics

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve
![ROC Curve](Images/roc_curve.png)

- **Accuracy**: ~97%
- **Precision** and **Recall** are both high, indicating strong performance.
- **AUC = 1.00** ‚Äî note: this may indicate potential overfitting due to multicollinearity.

---

 Multicollinearity Analysis

We found several **highly correlated features** (e.g., `radius_mean` with `area_mean`), which may contribute to overfitting.

Next Steps

- Reduce feature redundancy
- Try regularization techniques (e.g., L1/L2)
- Compare with other models (Random Forest, SVM)
- Cross-validation for robustness
